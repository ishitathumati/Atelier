# Atelier
This app is a means for aspiring artists to upload their art and gain a following. Many social media apps allow people to share their art, but this is masked by all the other things one can do on social media. This app would restrict users to posting art, commenting, critiquing, and liking art. There would be several categories based on art media and art themes, and certain restrictions would be placed to ensure the app is being used appropriately. The app would also allow artists to sell and trade their work. Artists would also be able to congregate and work together to do partner projects. Non-artist users of the app would be able to buy and rate art.
