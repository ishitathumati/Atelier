# Welcome to Atelier

A prevalent issue artists face is the struggle to make a consistent and stable living from their work. There are many excellent artists out there yet a sparse number of consumers who will buy their art. Only certain top-tier artists gain widespread popularity and a solid income. This app is a means for aspiring artists to upload their art and gain a following. Many social media apps allow people to share their art, but this is masked by all the other things one can do on social media. 

#### Here Comes Our Idea

Our app lets users post just their art, find and become friends with other artists, explore other beautiful artwork, and chat with fellow creatives! Atelier doesn't just let you connect and explore the amazing world of art, but it also lets aspiring creatives list a price for their work and connect with interested buyers, collectors and collaborators through our chat feature so that passionate artists can turn their heart-felt work into a product. The opportunity to get recognized in their community and truly experience appreciation for their work in multiple ways is just another cherry on the top.

# More Cool Features Coming Soon

In the future we hope to implement three major changes. The first feature we would like to implement is integrating a secure paying system so users can directly sell and buy art. We believe this will simplify making a transaction and also enhance the user experience. Our next goal is to tailor the explore page for each individual user, based on the accounts they follow or the posts they like. We want to identify these patterns, so we cater to the specific interests of each individual within broad spectrum, that is art. The final feature we plan on implementing is Stories. Stories within Atelier will allow users to capture and post related images and video content in a slideshow format. The content of the Story will be available for only a certain amount of time, approximately 24 hours. We believe this feature will make it possible for users to showcase their art without creating an excess amount of posts on their page. We hope we can implement these changes to give artists a unique platform while enhancing their experience on our app
